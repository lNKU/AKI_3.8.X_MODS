My personal collection of small-to-medium effect modifications to the EFT experience that, in my opinion, massively improve the gameplay experience.

Some features of this collection:

    Larger currency stack sizes.

    GP Coins and Bitcoins can now be stacked up to 5.

    Armor and Armored Vests can now be worn at the same time.

    Unlimited key usages (Factory and Marked Rooms can be used indefinitely.)

    Valuable keys are highlighted Purple with normal keys highlighted Blue.

    SMG-class weapons can be equipped in the pistol holster.
